This repo contains the slides, data, and Jupyter Notebook for the EuroPython2016 talk: How can machine learning help to predict changes in size of Atlantic herring?

The goal of the talk is to demonstrate how Python can be used for scientific data analysis. The algorithm implemented is Gradient Boosting Regression Trees available in SciKit-learn library.

This research was supported by a grant from the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (Ecosystem tipping points: learning from the past to manage for the future, project code 2015-NC-MS-3). CH received a PhD scholarship under the Sea Change strategy supported by the Marine Institute and the Marine Research Sub-Program of the National Development Plan 2007â€“2013 (Grant-Aid Agreement: PhD/FS/07/007 (01)).
